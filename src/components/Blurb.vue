While freelancing, I've gained experience in developing web applications, communicating directly with clients while solving their problems and addressing their business concerns.</span></p>

    <p class="content"><span>Through continuous self-study in conjunction with my work experience and my passion for technology, my desire is to continue to learn and build clean and result-oriented web applications.  When I'm not coding, I like to lift weights, examine the stock market, watch low-grade movies on VHS, and listen to records.</span></p>
