    <p class="content"><span class="content-indent">I was hired by Brandon Bordenkircher, CEO of 12 Tone Consulting, to design and develop the company's website from the ground up.  Brandon hired me because he needed a website that clearly articulated the services that 12 Tone Consulting provided as well as translating their brand identity to the web.  I took on the project because Brandon trusted me in my web development and design skillset which gave me 100% creative independence.  As a result of my work, 12 Tone Consulting saw 40% increase in business and increased their web traffic by 85%.</span></p>

    <p class="content">"Elliot was flexible and built my website around my vision â€“ all the while patiently explaining the pros and cons of various decisions so I could change my mind."</p>
